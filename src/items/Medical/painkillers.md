### Gameplay:

**Detailed Description:**

Painkillers are one of the least favoured medical items in the game due to how it works, but they are quite powerful when used effectively due to the nature of its usage. They’re a must have as almost any class, and are great at patching up small to medium amounts of damage quickly.
When used there is no initial health replenishment but after a couple seconds you will start to slowly regenerate a consisent amount of health up until you hit the cap of 50 hp. Painkillers also remove the concussed and burned status effects, which serves to nullify the effects of explosions.
Due to these attributes, it is common to see players use painkillers out of combat or in flexible/less tense gun fights, as a means of ensuring that they do not lack their maximum health. They also have a great use-case when it comes to healing after a successful fight.
